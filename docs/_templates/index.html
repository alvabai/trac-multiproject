  <h3>Coming from Trac?</h3>
  <p>MultiProject <i>is not a fork</i> from Trac, but a plugin. Having that said, it currently requires a bit more effort than
  enabling the component. Here are few reasons why to see the trouble:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Project creation from web UI</li>
      <li>User management from web UI</li>
      <li>Prepackage collection of plugins to work together</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>License</h3>
  <p>Plugin code and related scripts are licensed under BSD. Some bundled resources, like jQuery and jQuery UI are dual licensed
     under MIT and GPL version 2.</p>
