This is your project wiki start page. We created this page to help you get started, now just press the "Edit this page" button below to start editing this page.

== Getting started ==
Here is a list of things you probably want to do when starting a project
 * Use [/admin/general/permissions Admin|Permissions] to give rights for your project team
   - If you flagged your project as public (default) anyone can visit your project, but only registered users can write messages in your discussion boards and open tickets.
   - If you flagged the project as private, then you should start adding some new members that can access your project and work with you.
   - Either way, you can add ''project members'' that will have write access to your project and can start pushing software in the SCM.
   - If the default groups are not enough for you, you can add more.
 * Tailor your ticketing system to have types and resolutions suitable for your project in [/admin/ticket Admin|Ticket System]
   - Defaults usually work fine, but it's good to be aware of the possibility to make changes
   - You can also [/admin/ticket/milestones define a roadmap] in the ticket system panel with milestones
* Last but not least, create your SummaryPage to show more information about your project, embed images and videos and deep link to your code or documentation
* Want to know more? Check out the [/home/wiki/HelpAndSupport Help and Support] pages
